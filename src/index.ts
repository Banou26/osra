/**
 * Expose a value to whoever connects, and get back what they exposed.
 *
 * Wrap `value` in `context` to build it once per connection, which is what lets one server answer
 * each realm differently (scoped resolvers per app) instead of sharing one object across all of them.
 * A bare function stays a plain exposed endpoint, so the wrapper is what disambiguates the two.
 *
 * The result is both awaitable and async-iterable: awaiting gives the first peer, iterating gives
 * every peer as it connects. Both hand back the same shape.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const remote = await expose(resolvers, { transport })            // the first peer's value
 * for await (const remote of expose(resolvers, { transport })) { } // every peer's value
 * ```
 *
 * `connection` decides what that shape is. Omit it and it is the peer's value, which is what expose
 * has always resolved to. Return whatever a connection should mean instead:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const { value, context } = await expose(resolvers, {
 *   transport,
 *   connection: ({ value, context }) => ({ value, context }),
 * })
 *
 * for await (const peer of expose(resolvers, {
 *   transport,
 *   connection: ({ value, context }) => ({ value, context }),
 * })) {
 *   if (!allowed(peer.context.origin)) peer.context.abort?.()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A peer's identity is whatever the transport can observe merged over whatever the caller declared
 * in `context`. Only a window message carries a browser-set origin and source; a MessagePort message
 * carries neither, so a port-based server declares what it learned when it received the port.
 * Observed fields win over declared ones, so a declaration can never spoof a real origin.
